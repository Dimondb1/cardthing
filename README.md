# CardScout

Compare UK prices for sealed trading card game products. Django 5.2, SQLite by
default, no JavaScript framework.

## Run it locally

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate          # also creates all default site wording
python manage.py seed_catalogue   # real games, sets and products, no prices yet
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

Site: http://127.0.0.1:8000/ Admin: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

Project rules for anyone (or any AI) working on the code are in `CLAUDE.md`.

For a design review without real retailers, `python manage.py seed_demo`
loads fictional retailers on `.example` domains with generated prices. It only
runs with `DJANGO_DEBUG` on, and `--flush` replaces what is there.

## Getting real prices in

1. **Products.** `seed_catalogue` loads the current sets and products. Check
   the release dates and add each product's **barcode** (EAN) in
   Admin > Products. Barcodes are how imported prices are matched. Upload a
   product image on the same page.
2. **Retailers.** Add each retailer in Admin > Retailers with its standard
   delivery charge and free delivery threshold, then choose a price source:
   - **Shopify store**: enter the shop address. Most UK card shops run on
     Shopify and publish their products at `/products.json`. Check the shop's
     terms allow automated price checks before using this.
   - **Product feed (CSV)**: enter the feed address from your affiliate
     network or the retailer. Columns `ean`, `url`, `price` are needed;
     `title`, `availability` and `delivery` are used if present. Common
     column names from Awin and Google Merchant feeds are recognised.
   - **Entered by hand**: add listings yourself under the product.
3. **Import.** `python manage.py import_prices` fetches every retailer with a
   source, or `import_prices <retailer-slug>` for one, or `--feed file.csv`
   for a local file. Run it from cron, hourly is sensible. Each run is
   recorded in Admin > Price imports with the retailer products that could
   not be matched, so you can add the missing barcodes.
4. **History.** `python manage.py snapshot_daily_prices` once a day keeps the
   price history complete.

Retailer products the site no longer lists are marked out of stock at that
retailer after an import. Nothing on the public site is invented: a product
with no listings says so.

## Search as you type

The search box shows results while the visitor types, with the cheapest
delivered price and stock for each, from `/api/search/`. The form still
submits to the full results page, so search works with JavaScript off. The
"Checking lowest prices" message and the "All results" link are editable in
admin.

## Project layout

| App         | What it holds |
|-------------|---------------|
| `catalogue` | Games, sets, products, retailers, listings (one retailer's offer for one product), daily lowest prices and click counts. Price queries live in `catalogue/pricing.py`, search in `catalogue/search.py`. |
| `content`   | Editable site wording (`SiteContent`), its defaults in `content/registry.py`, and the `{% copy %}` template tag. |
| `web`       | Public views, templates, CSS, the font and the favicon. |

## Editing site wording

Almost every sentence, heading and button label on the public site is stored in
the database and edited in **Admin > Site wording**.

- **Site text** lists everything except legal wording, in the order it appears
  on each page. Filter by page, by type (heading, short text, paragraphs,
  button label) or by whether it has been edited. Search by key or wording.
- **Legal and disclosure text** holds the commission and independence
  statements and the price disclaimer. They are kept apart so they are not
  changed by accident, can't be left empty and are always shown.

Each item shows where it appears, the default wording, and any placeholders it
supports. Placeholders such as `{price}` or `{retailer}` are filled in when the
page is shown, for example `Buy for {price}` becomes "Buy for £44.99".

To undo an edit, tick **Restore default wording** and save, or select several
rows and use the **Restore default wording** action. Unticking **Use this
wording** shows the default but keeps your edit for later.

Saving checks the wording and explains any problem: em dashes, unknown
placeholders, HTML, or line breaks in one-line text are rejected.

Edits show on the next page load. There is no cache to clear.

### What is not editable in admin

Short functional labels tied to data stay in code: stock statuses (In stock,
Pre-order, Out of stock) and product types in `catalogue/models.py`, filter and
sort labels in `web/views.py`, relative times ("18 minutes ago") in
`web/templatetags/cardscout.py`, screen reader hints such as "(opens in a new
tab)", and the static `500.html` page, which must work when the database does
not.

### Adding a new piece of wording

1. Add an `Entry` to `content/registry.py` with a key starting with its page,
   for example `product.delivery_note`.
2. Use it in a template: `{% load sitecopy %}{% copy "product.delivery_note" %}`.
   For numbers, `{% copy_count "browse.count" total %}` picks the `.one` or
   `.other` key.
3. Run `python manage.py sync_site_content` (it also runs after every
   `migrate`). Existing edits are never overwritten.

The test suite fails if a template uses a key that is missing from the
registry, or if any default contains an em dash or an exclamation mark.

## Changing the look

Every colour, size, radius and spacing value is a CSS custom property in
`web/static/css/tokens.css`. `site.css` uses nothing else.

| To                           | Change |
|------------------------------|--------|
| Reduce the corner radius     | `--radius`, `--radius-tag` |
| Make pages denser or roomier | `--density` (1 is the default, 0.875 is denser) |
| Change the accent colour     | `--color-accent`, `--color-accent-soft` |
| Make product titles bigger   | `--text-product-title` |
| Widen the page               | `--page-width` |
| Change heading or price width | `--stretch-display`, `--stretch-price` |

The typeface is Archivo, self-hosted from `web/static/fonts/` (SIL Open Font
License), so there are no requests to Google Fonts.

The wordmark is plain text in `web/templates/web/includes/wordmark.html`.
Replace that file to change the logo everywhere. The favicon is
`web/static/img/favicon.svg`.

## Prices

- A **listing** is one retailer's offer: product link, item price, delivery
  charge for one item to a UK address, stock status and when it was last
  checked. The delivered price is worked out by the database.
- The **cheapest delivered price** only uses listings that are in stock or on
  pre-order and were checked within `CARDSCOUT_STALE_AFTER_HOURS` (72 by
  default). Older listings still appear on the product page, marked as not
  checked recently.
- Custom importers should call `catalogue.pricing.record_check(listing,
  price=..., delivery_cost=..., availability=...)` after checking a retailer.
  It updates the listing and today's lowest price. The built-in Shopify and
  CSV importers are in `catalogue/importers.py`.
- Run `python manage.py snapshot_daily_prices` once a day (for example from
  cron) so price history and "Price drops this week" have no gaps.
- Retailer affiliate links: set **Affiliate link format** on the retailer, for
  example `https://network.example/click?id=123&url={url}`. All outbound links
  go through `/go/<listing id>/`, which counts the click (no personal data is
  stored) and redirects.

## Settings

| Environment variable           | Default | Notes |
|--------------------------------|---------|-------|
| `DJANGO_DEBUG`                 | on      | Set to `0` in production. |
| `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`            |         | Required when debug is off. |
| `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`         | `localhost,127.0.0.1` | Comma separated. |
| `DJANGO_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`  |         | Comma separated, with scheme. |
| `DJANGO_SQLITE_PATH`           | `db.sqlite3` | |
| `CARDSCOUT_CONTACT_EMAIL`      |         | Shows the "Report a problem" section on the how it works page. |
| `CARDSCOUT_STALE_AFTER_HOURS`  | 72      | |

## Tests

```sh
python manage.py test
```

Besides behaviour, the tests render every public page and fail on em dashes,
exclamation marks and stock marketing phrases.
